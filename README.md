### Dataset Summary

**A dataset for answering complex questions that require reasoning over multiple web snippets**

ComplexWebQuestions is a new dataset that contains a large set of complex questions in natural language, and can be used in multiple ways:

  - By interacting with a search engine, which is the focus of our paper (Talmor and Berant, 2018);
  - As a reading comprehension task: we release 12,725,989 web snippets that are relevant for the questions, and were collected during the development of our model; 
  - As a semantic parsing task: each question is paired with a SPARQL query that can be executed against Freebase to retrieve the answer.

## Dataset Structure

QUESTION FILES

The dataset contains 34,689 examples divided into 27,734 train, 3,480 dev, 3,475 test.
each containing:

```
"ID‚Äù: The unique ID of the example; 
"webqsp_ID": The original WebQuestionsSP ID from which the question was constructed; 
"webqsp_question": The WebQuestionsSP Question from which the question was constructed; 
"machine_question": The artificial complex question, before paraphrasing; 
"question": The natural language complex question; 
"sparql": Freebase SPARQL query for the question. Note that the SPARQL was constructed for the machine question, the actual question after paraphrasing
may differ from the SPARQL. 
"compositionality_type": An estimation of the type of compositionally. {composition, conjunction, comparative, superlative}. The estimation has not been manually verified,
 the question after paraphrasing may differ from this estimation.
"answers": a list of answers each containing answer: the actual answer; answer_id: the Freebase answer id; aliases: freebase extracted aliases for the answer.
"created": creation time
```
